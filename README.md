# jklm-cheat

This software is in fact a dictionnary that output a word containing the letters you put in.
I developped this software for a local contest between friends, It should not be used online on the website jklm.fun against other players.

The file dico.txt contains a list of words in a certain language (french in this case). No accents should be used and there should be one word per line.
You can create your own dictionnary of course.
The file main.cpp is the main code of the programm.

How does it work?
You launch the software, you join a JKLM Bomb Party game, you type the letters you have to find in your word, you press escape and the software will found a word with those letters in the same order, it will also copy it and erase what you wrote to paste it and auto press enter.

It can find a word and send it in less than a second, which is of course sufficient to win the game.

Some parts of the code where found on other websites, which are credited in the code.

Disclaimer:
This software should not be used in online games against people you don't know, it was developped for a contest and should be used for educational purposes only!
